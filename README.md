## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the complete set of documents, numerical simulations, and computational tools that constitute the **Unified Theory of Motion** — a framework in which **mass, energy, geometry, and particle-like structures** arise from *organized, stationary patterns of motion* in a continuous field.

The work develops:

- a decomposition of motion into **density** and **phase**,  
- mass as **stationary organized motion**,  
- stable **toroidal solitons** as geometric quanta of motion,  
- the natural emergence of **quantized geometry**,  
- and a unified bridge between **Relativity, quantum behavior, and field theory**.

All documents are organized in progressive order, from the foundational insight to advanced theoretical phenomenology.

## 🌱 01 — Foundation
Conceptual origin of the entire theory.

- 1___The_Unified_Theory_of_Motion__A_Continuum_Bridge_Between_Relativity_and_Wave_Particle_Duality.pdf

This document introduces the fundamental idea:

> Motion is the primary substance of physical reality,  
> and mass/energy/geometry arise from its organization.

## 🌳 02 — Framework
Mathematical formulation and numerical construction of toroidal solitons.

Includes:

- A_Unified_Framework_of_Organized_Motion__Stable_Toroidal_Configurations_in_a_Complex_Scalar_Field.pdf  
- Documents 2–6, covering:
  - scalar field formulation  
  - toroidal Q-ball solutions  
  - numerical relaxation  
  - internal phase winding  
  - stability and validation  

This is the **core technical body** of the theory.

# 🔬 Scientific Highlights

The Unified Theory of Motion establishes a coherent, continuum-based framework in which:

Stable toroidal solitons emerge naturally
from the relaxation of a simple complex scalar field, without gauge fields, Skyrme terms, or topological constraints.

Phase winding acts as the confinement mechanism
generating the toroidal geometry through organized internal motion.

Mass arises as a stationary equilibrium of motion,
where internal circulation stabilizes localized energy concentrations.

Binary interactions produce long-lived molecular bound states,
showing attraction, nonlinear overlap, recoil, and oscillatory stabilization in a purely conservative field system.

Geometric quantization is governed by the winding number 
𝑛
n
yielding discrete toroidal configurations with predictable radii, energy scaling, and stability regimes.

Gravitational-like behavior emerges from phase gradients,
where curvature, attraction, and effective “lens-like” dynamics arise from coherent organization rather than imposed geometry.

Continuum mechanics, GR low-energy limits, and QFT structure appear as effective theories,
derived directly from the underlying principle:
organized motion as the fundamental substance of physical reality.

The entire framework is fully numerically reproducible, built on transparent relaxation–evolution pipelines, and implemented in a minimal continuum field-theoretic model without hidden assumptions.
